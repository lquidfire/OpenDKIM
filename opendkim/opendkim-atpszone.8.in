.SH DESCRIPTION
.B opendkim-atpszone
generates a file suitable for use with
.I named(8)
to publish a set of domains authorized as third-party signers for a local
domain.

The
.I dataset
parameter should specify a set of data as described in the
.I opendkim(8)
man page.  It can currently refer to flat files, Sleepycat databases,
comma-separated lists, LDAP directories or SQL databases.  The keys in the
named database are assumed to comprise a set of domains that are to be
advertised using the experimental Authorized Third-Party Signers protocol
as permitted to sign mail using DKIM on behalf of the local domain.  Values
in the database are not used.
.SH OPTIONS
.TP
.I \-A
Adds a "._atps" suffix to records in the zone file.
.TP
.I \-C contact
Uses
.I contact
as the contact information to be used when an SOA record is generated (see
.I \-S
below).  If not specified, the userid of the executing user and the local
hostname will be used; if the executing user can't be determined,
"hostmaster" will be used.
.TP
.I \-E secs
When generating an SOA record (see
.I \-S
below), use
.I secs
as the default record expiration time.  The default is 604800.
.TP
.I \-h hash
Specifies which SHA hash algorithm to use.  Must be one of "none" or "sha256",
with "sha256" being the default if it is available.
.TP
.I \-N nslist
Specifies a comma-separated list of nameservers, which will be output in
NS records before the TXT records.  The first nameserver in this list will
also be used in the SOA record (if
.I \-S
is also specified) as the authority hostname.
.TP
.I \-o file
Sends output to the named
.I file
rather than standard output.
.TP
.I \-r secs
When generating an SOA record (see
.I \-S
below), use
.I secs
as the zone refresh time.  The default is 10800.
.TP
.I \-R secs
When generating an SOA record (see
.I \-S
below), use
.I secs
as the zone retry time.  The default is 1800.
.TP
.I \-S
Asks for an SOA record to be generated at the top of the output.  The
content of this output can be controlled using the
.I \-E,
.I \-r,
.I \-R,
.I \-T
options.  The serial number will be generated based on the current time of
day.
.TP
.I \-t ttl
Puts a TTL (time-to-live) value of
.I ttl
on all records output.  The units are in seconds.
.TP
.I \-T secs
When generating an SOA record (see
.I \-S
below), use
.I secs
as the default record TTL time.  The default is 86400.
.TP
.I \-u domain
Produce output suitable for use as input to
.B nsupdate(8)
to add ATPS records to the named 
.I domain.
.TP
.I \-v
Increases the verbosity of debugging output written to standard error.

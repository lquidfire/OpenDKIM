opendkim (2.11.0~beta2-2) unstable; urgency=medium

    The opendkim package has undergone a general overhaul. As a result, a few
    stats utilities and additional documentation are now included. More
    importantly, note that most utilities whose name begins with "opendkim-"
    are now installed in /usr/sbin instead of /usr/bin. This is to follow the
    intention of the upstream project more closely, as these programs are
    designed and documented as system utilities.

    We remind users that opendkim is best configured by editing
    /etc/opendkim.conf. The legacy defaults file at /etc/default/opendkim is
    still available, as is the script /lib/opendkim/opendkim.service.generate.
    However, these provide no additional value over the default configuration
    file /etc/opendkim.conf. Please take this opportunity to review your
    configuration setup.
